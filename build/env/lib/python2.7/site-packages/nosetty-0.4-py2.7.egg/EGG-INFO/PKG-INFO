Description: nosetty is a plugin for [http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/ nose], a test runner for python.  It accepts various commands at the terminal, giving you some one-on-one quality time with your tracebacks.  Most importantly, editing a failure point is as easy as typing a number.  How about a screenshot?
